# t-test
an example of R code for an independent sample t-test

```
# load the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# define the two samples
sample1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
sample2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# perform the t-test
t.test(sample1, sample2, paired = FALSE)
```

This code first loads the `tidyverse` library, which includes a number of useful functions for data manipulation and analysis. Then, it defines two samples and performs an independent sample t-test using the `t.test()` function. The `paired = FALSE` argument specifies that the samples are independent, rather than paired. The output of the t-test will be the test statistic and the p-value, which can be used to determine whether the difference between the samples is statistically significant.
